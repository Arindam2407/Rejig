REJIG APP

- A fork of Lens Protocol
- Focus on NFT Auctions
- Programmatic yield determination

Created by Arindam Singh

-Users will be able to create profiles just like in the Lens protocol - no need for whitelisting with the stipulation that one address can create only one contract.

-There is no collect functionality.

-Instead, we have added NFT auctions for posts which creators/owners/sellers can choose to turn on or off (there are two functions - post and postNFT).

-There is a minimum follower count set to sell NFTs.

-NFT auctions will be in the form of 7-day Dutch Auctions (price decreases by a preset rate)

-Sellers can also choose to include ERC-20 tokens in the sale (included in the auction price of NFT). The number of different tokens is capped at 3.

-The sale money (for now, only in ETH) will be divided between the owners and the protocol.

-The protocol money will be divided between money directly going to the protocol and money used to issue bonds to the buyers.

-Interest rate of the bonds issued to the buyers will depend on the difference in number of followers between the seller and buyer (could also be negative)

-Preference will be given to those with the highest difference of followers. There is a minimum follower count set to buy NFTs.

-The list of NFT sales arranged according to the follower difference will be updated every 24 hours and bonds will be issued.

-Interest would be payable to only the top 30% of the buyers (according to buying price) after every update.

-Buyers will be able to determine the bond maturation periods with four options - Short, Medium, Medium-Long, Long.

-The yield on the bold will be vested linearly over the maturation period.

-Following, Commenting and Mirroring are the same as the Lens Protocol.

-Upgradeability is the same as the Lens Protocol.
