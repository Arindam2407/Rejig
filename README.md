- A fork of Lens Protocol
- Focus on NFT Auctions

Created by Arindam Singh

-Users will be able to create profiles just like in the Lens protocol - no need for whitelisting with the stipulation that one address can create only one account.

-There is no collect functionality.

-Instead, we have added NFT auctions for posts which creators/owners/sellers can choose to turn on or off (there are two functions - post and postNFT).

-There is a minimum follower count set to sell NFTs.

-NFT auctions will be in the form of 7-day Dutch Auctions (price decreases by a preset rate)

-Sellers can also choose to include ERC-20 tokens in the sale (included in the auction price of NFT). The number of different tokens is capped at 3.

-The sale money (for now, only in ETH) will be divided between the owners and the protocol.

-Following, Commenting and Mirroring are the same as the Lens Protocol.

-Upgradeability is the same as the Lens Protocol.
